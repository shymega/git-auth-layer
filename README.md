# git-auth-layer

A flexible, lightweight alternative to Gitolite.

Will be configured via TOML, and run as a daemon (?).

It will be compatible with cgit, and possibly other frontends.

Fine-grained permissions (branches, etc) model will be a core feature, as well
as Git hooks. Email notifications and branch protection will also be a core
feature.
